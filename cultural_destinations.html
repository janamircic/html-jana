                by the World of Architecture as one of the most original and ambitious modern buildings.
                Architect Francesc de Paula Villar was initally assigned to the project, however he was quickly 
                replaced by a young architect called Antoni Gaudí who took over the project at the early age of 31. 
                Gaudí completely changed the desing from the initial neo gothic style to a modernist style.
                The project started in 1882 and it is still today under construction. </p>
