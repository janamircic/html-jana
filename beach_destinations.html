            <h5 class="card-title">Zakynthos, Greece</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Navagio Beach was originally known as “Agios Georgios Beach.” In 1980, the freightliner MV Panagiotis ran aground in the waters around 
                Zakynthos Island during stormy weather and poor visibility. The ship was smuggling contraband including cigarettes and alcohol. The Panagiotis was
                 abandoned after running aground, and it still rests half-buried in the limestone gravel of the beach, which is now known worldwide by its nickname
                  “Navagio” (“Shipwreck”). </p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Ibiza, Spain</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Aguas Blancas is one of the favourite beaches for island residents. Backed with beautifully coloured and textured high cliffs, 
                it has unblemished surroundings with a dramatic effect. The beach has golden sand that is soft and fine, and the sea bed is also sandy but with 
                some rocks dotted around - so watch your step!</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat, France</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat's beaches are ideal for peaceful relaxation. Nestling all around the peninsula, they offer a wide range of 
                panoramic views across the sea, the bay of Beaulieu-sur-Mer and the Eze cliffs as well as the famous harbour at Villefranche-sur-Mer. Sunbathers 
                and swimmers can often be found along the paths, around a cove or lying on flat rocks. The five beaches on the peninsula are all open to the public
                (although two of them have private areas). There are showers and toilets during the summer season. The beaches in Cap-Ferrat are made of fine gravel.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Ulcinj, Montenegro</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Copacabana being a part of the Long Beach, located on the way that leads for the river Bojana, is one of the most beautiful, 
                the most comfortable beaches with high quality services not only in Ulcinj, but in Montenegro and wide. Copacabana is one of 19 beaches in Montenegro
                 that proudly carry blue flag. It does proudly carry this title because Copacabana fulfills all world standards and conditions for a pleasant and
                  enjoyable holiday. </p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Mgarr, Malta</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Gnejna is a rare little gem of a beach on the West coast of Malta, which is sandy and fairly secluded and not very popular among 
                tourists as a result. It’s good proof that being a little more adventurous and exploring your holiday location can pay off. Being the “go to” beach 
                for the Maltese living in the nearby village of Mġarr, it’s a nice alternative to some of the other, busier beaches. A few kiosks and public convenience
                 sit on the edge of the beach and it’s considered to be a family-friendly beach with a fairly shallow shoreline, but not necessarily easy to reach if 
                 you’re not driving there yourself.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">North Yorkshire, England</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Whitby is an interesting seaside town with quayside arcades, beautiful scenery, and some of the finest fish and chips in the country.
                You can visit throughout the year, but the North Sea can be mighty chilly in anything but peak summer. The village of Sandsend, right at the end of 
                Whitby Beach, is one of the more popular places to sit in the sun. You’ll find the usual traditional British beach experiences in and around Whitby 
                during the summer months, like donkey rides, ice cream vans, and colorful beach huts. It’s also a good beach for surfing, kite flying and fossil hunting. </p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Sicily, Italy</h5>
            <p class="card-text">A small island close to Taormina in Sicily, Isola Bella is located in the middle of a small bay and is well-known for its beautiful 
                plants and warm calm waters. This beach is very popular among travelers because of the amazing views of the Ionian Sea and its crystal-clear blue waters.
                 The great thing about Isola Bella is that it is protected by the bay, which means that conditions for water activities such as swimming, snorkeling and
                  paddle boarding are ideal. You can access the island by walking across a path that connects the mainland or by a small cable car that runs from 
                  Taormina to Mazzaro.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">Lagos, Portugal</h5>
              <p class="card-text">One of the most recognisable symbols of Algarve tourism are the wooden steps leading down to Praia do Camilo, one of Lagos’
                   best beaches. Camilo has plenty of unusual rock formations and beautiful translucent water, but being just a 30-minute walk from the centre 
                   of town it does get busy, particularly when the tide is high.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">Antalya, Turkey</h5>
              <p class="card-text">If you like to stretch out at the beach then you will appreciate Konyaalti, one of Antalya’s urban beaches. It’s another 
                  extensive sandy beach which proves why the Turkish Riviera is one of the best beach vacation destinations in the Med. It goes on for miles! 
                  It’s close to the city so you won’t get bored, and the Bey mountains provide a stunning backdrop. Konyaalti more popular with well-heeled locals 
                  than foreign holidaymakers, and behind the beach you’ll find an endless array of food courts and tasty treats.</p>
