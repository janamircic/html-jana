            <h5 class="card-title">Saint Moritz, Switzerland</h5>
            <p class="card-text">The number of world ski competitions that have been hosted at St. Moritz should tell you something about this famous resort: 
                this is world-class skiing. The Winter Olympics were held here in 1928 and 1948, and St. Moritz hosts the biennial Alpine World Ski Championship.
                 You can often see competitions at its Olympic ski-jump.St. Moritz is one of Europe's first — some claim the first — winter resorts, and it still 
                 has a smart clientele and distinct air of luxury. The après-ski scene fits the image, so bring your designer jeans. There are plenty of things to 
                 do besides skiing: ice skating, tobogganing, Nordic skiing, bobsledding, and kite skiing, and in February, you can watch the annual White Turf St. 
                 Moritz, the world's only skijoring horserace.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Bavaria, Germany</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Rising to 2,962 meters, Zugspitze is Germany's highest mountain, and its popularity with skiers is enhanced by the beautiful 
                Bavarian town of Garmisch-Partenkirchen at its foot. From its summit, which can now be accessed by a new cable car, extends a 360-degree panorama 
                that reaches as far as 250 kilometers and includes mountain peaks in four countries. From the top of the lifts, you can ski the glacier, 2,700 meters 
                above sea level—so high that it is often above clouds that cover the valley skies. All levels of skiers will find plenty of choices in the 40 kilometers
                 of trails at the Garmisch-Classic ski area, interlinked across three mountains: Hausberg, Kreuzeck, and Alpspitze. For extreme challenges, there's the
                famed Kandahar Downhill and other courses that were used in the 1936 Winter Olympics and since then for the International Alpine Skiing Championships.</p>

                from a location which 48 years ago was qualified as “hostile”, but reveals all its beauty and its ability to offer a unique ski experience. </p>

            <p class="card-text">Cortina d'Ampezzo is a world-renowned resort in Northern Italy. It is 40 kilometres from the Austrian border it is famous for 
                the quality of its slopes and infrastructure and is within easy reach (highways, buses, Venice and Verona airports). Cortina d'Ampezzo -or simply 
                Cortina- is Italy's best known mountain resort.Skiing in Cortina is an all-encompassing experience: skiing on perfectly groomed slopes is even better
                 when you know you will stop for lunch and try a local dish at one of the many delicious mountain huts. And while you ski, remember to stop from time
                  to time to enjoy the uncomparable views on the Dolomites and beautiful valley. After a day out, everyone heads to the town centre to stroll around 
                  pedestrian Corso Italia. This legendary street offers one of the best shopping scenes in the Alps, but if you'd rather meet up with your friends, 
                  head to one of the many wine bars for aperitivo. And the day is not complete without dinner out: let yourself be spoilt for choice between a fancy 
                  restaurant and a traditional agriturismo.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Megeve, France</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Megève is one of the best ski resorts in France. Celebrities, actors and crowned heads love Megève because it is chic and casual.
                 Located right in the heart of the Mont-Blanc massif, Megève’s skiing area benefits from a quality snow cover and an exceptional setting so that 
                 you can fully appreciate the 445 km of the Evasion Mont-Blanc skiing area. When skiing in Megève, one contemplates old historical farmhouses dotted 
                 along the slopes, one tastes local products in one of the many quality high altitude restaurants, of which only Megève holds the secret.
                 This authentic mountain village has the charm of yesteryear, it also offers more than 260 km of slopes and a wide choice of magnificent 5-star hotels. 
                 We particularly like the "M de Megève" Hotel located in the heart of the village. It combines modernity and tradition with an incredible wellness 
                 experience with its "Cinq Mondes" Spa.</p>

            <p class="card-text">The combination of the special experiences for which Gstaad is so famous is unrivalled. It cannot be found anywhere else and 
                makes Gstaad the ‘last paradise in a crazy world’ (quote by actress Julie Andrews, a regular visitor to Gstaad). The prestige value of the brand
                 Gstaad comes top of the list.The internationally renowned brand which is associated with luxury and high society creates a value that resonates
                  far beyond the actual main target group. It is therefore not surprising to see Gstaad featured in the ranking of the most beautiful ski resorts
                   in Europe and luxurious ski resorts in Europe. Local products, such as cheese and meat as well as craft traditions, are very popular. 
                   Houses with a chalet architectural style dominate the villages in the region, of which Gstaad represents the tourist centre. Some of the 
                   cosy buildings date from the 15th century.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Morzine, France</h5>
            <p class="card-text">This postcard-perfect alpine village sits in the center of Portes du Soleil, a 12-resort ski area with 306 runs spread between 
                two countries. The addition of two new chairlifts this season will provide easier access between Morzine-Avoriaz and the Swiss sector in Champéry
                 - Les Crosets. A variety of terrain makes Morzine a family favorite. At the top of the Pléney lift from Morzine you’ll find easy runs for beginners 
                 as well as the mountain’s mythical race piste right into the village. Horse-drawn heritage tours and new torchlit snowshoe tours let you take in 
                 the area’s charm at a slower pace.</p>
