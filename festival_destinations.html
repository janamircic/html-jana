                 Viva San Fermín, Gora San Fermín” (“People of Pamplona, Long Live Saint Fermín”). The best-known part of the festival is the running of the bulls,
                  or the encierro. From July 7 to July 14 the bulls used in the daily bullfights are running through the streets of the town. In addition to the 
                  secular events, the Procession of Saint Fermín, a religious celebration, takes place the morning of July 7. Other events associated with the
                   fiesta include the comparsa, a parade featuring large puppets carried by the marchers, as well as numerous parties and spontaneous gatherings.

            <p class="card-text">Oktoberfest began as the marriage ceremony between Prince Ludwig and Princess Therese on October 12, 1810. All of the townspeople 
                were invited to attend the festival, which took place in the fields outside of the city gates. Following the wedding the fields were named
                 Theresienwiese after the Princess, and the party was such a hit that the townspeople asked King Ludwig to continue the celebration the following 
                 year. Today the remnants of the gates still stand and the fields, known by locals as the Wies’n, now host the largest beer festival in the world:
                  Oktoberfest! What was a simple wedding celebration has transformed into a 17 or 18-day festival in which 7 million people from around the world 
                  participate in, consuming more than 6 million liters of Bavarian beer. That’s 1 million gallons of beer! Oktoberfest officially begins on the 
                  second to last Saturday in September at noon when the mayor of Munich taps the first barrel at the Schottenhamel Tent, crying "O’zapft is” 
                  (It’s open). The festival concludes the first Sunday of October following German reunification day on October 5. </p>

            <p class="card-text">La Tomatina is a food fight festival held on the last Wednesday of August each year in the town of Buñol (history) near to Valencia 
                in Spain. Thousands upon thousands of people make their way from all corners of the world to fight in this 'World's Biggest Food Fight' where more 
                than one hundred metric tons of over-ripe tomatoes are thrown in the streets. Prior to 2013 anywhere from 40,000 to 50,000 
                (reported to be 50,000 in 2012) people crammed into this huge tomato fight, greatly expanding Bunol's normal 9,000 person population. 
                Since 2013 official ticketing has been in place limiting the number of participants to just 20,000 lucky people. There is limited 
                accommodation for people who come to La Tomatina, so many people take the easier option of staying in nearby Valencia just 38km to Bunol
                 by bus or train. In preparation for the dirty mess that will ensue, shopkeepers use huge plastic covers on their storefronts in order to 
                 protect them from the carnage.</p>
