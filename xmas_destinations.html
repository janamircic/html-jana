            <p class="card-text">No matter whether you prefer enjoying the pre-Christmas season with a contemplative trip to the wintry forests and a cosy café 
                or bringing the year to a close with shopping or entertainment, Berlin always has something to offer: Visit the sights, go out for a cosy dinner 
                or experience a fascinating show. Because Berlin has a whole lot on offer in winter too. We particularly recommend the Berlin Christmas Markets.
                Christmas is one of the most magical times to be in Berlin. It is more than just a time to celebrate Santa Claus, it’s a time to endure the cold 
                and enjoy the fresh clean air. The city will urge you to withstand the cold through its charming outdoor activities that promise to keep your
                  body and spirit warm. Whether you celebrate Christmas or not, there are tons of things to see and do in Berlin during Christmastime, and you won’t 
                  be able to resist the enticing playful indulgences.</p>
